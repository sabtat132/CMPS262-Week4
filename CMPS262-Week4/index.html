    <h2>Sabrina Tatalias</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Sabrina Tatalias, and I am currently a 1st semester junior at Point Park University - graduating in December 2021! </p>
    <p>A little about myself is that I am a Rowland School of Business Ambassador, President of ITSO, and in the Honors Program at Point Park University.</p>
    <p>When I'm not on campus, you can find me working or volunteering. I'm on the board of a nonprofit in my community called the Bethel Park Community Foundation. On that board, I oversee our Marketing and PR efforts by overseeing the events, Facebook, website, and internship program.</p>
    <p>Since I came to Point Park University, I have been working as a Customer Care Rep at a local start-up in Pittsburgh. Starting February, I will be starting an internship at a marketing firm called Bounteous as a Marketing & Web Analytics Intern. Then, in the summer, I will be a Data Analyst intern at Gateway Health for their Data Services team working for the Data Management and Integration group.</p>
    <h2>Bryce Hayzlett</h2>
    <p>My name is Bryce and I've been attending Point Park University since Fall 2017. I'm majoring in Information Technology, minoring in History, and I'll be graduating Fall 2021.</p>
    <p>I'm best known on campus for being the President Pro-Tempore of the Student Government Association of Point Park University. I've been interested in student government since the start of the last Spring semester and have officailly been a member since September 2019, being elected as a Senator for the Rowland School of Business.</p>
    <p>I hope to continue my student government work until I graduate and I plan to run for Vice President during the upcoming elections.

  <div class="content">
    <h2>Sabrina</h2>
    <p>I have career aspirations to become a Data Scientist and CEO. Upon graduation, I can see myself getting a job by the title of Data Analyst, Customer Insight Analyst, Business Analyst, Data Scientist, and Project Manager. </p>
    <p>I have had a passion for data analytics since I was 16, so I strive to take on any opportunity that will allow me to reach my career goals.</p>
    <p>I don't know what kind of company I want to start yet. Lastly, I love volunteering and giving back, so I want to start a non-profit organization and later down the road, a scholarship in my name.</p>
    <p>I also want to be a Girl Scout Troop Leader - I currently am a Life Time Alum, and did Girl Scouts K-12, so  it's something I want to partake in longer.</p>
    <h2>Bryce</h2>
    <p>I haven't quite pinpointed what I'm looking to do once I graduate. I've been leaning more towards something with databases or a form of server management, but I'm not leaning strongly one way or the other.</p>
    <p>I've always had a niche for computers and technology, so when I started thinking about college IT was the obvious choice for me. I've been the family member or friend to go to when someone was having computer issues since I was around 13 years old.</p>
    <p>My main goal currently is to stay in Pittsburgh once I graduate. Coming from a small town means there's less opportunity back home than here in the city and I've always felt more at home here in the Pittsburgh area.</p>
    <p>I've found that I'm fairly passionate for our student government and I've managed to do some good in that role, but I don't plan on doing anything politically related after I obtain my degree.</p>
